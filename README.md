## Reflection
The article on DEV Community that discusses how software development practices evolve over time, especially with advances like AI and abstraction layers, and what this means for developers today. I found this interesting because it talked about under the era of AI, what developer should do. The author reviewed the history of software development as a increasing abstraction in computing from assembly to compiled to interpreted languages, which abstracts the code details and make programming easier. The next abstraction might be natural language.

So, what changes for developers and what skill will developers need? The article explains that "AI is not just abstracting code... it is also abstracting effort itself". It makes a strong developer focus more on describing in detail what they need, and articulate the problem with surprising accuracy in the future. What's more, AI is still weak at building and understanding complex relationships, and developers need architecture and system integration skills. Thus, software engineering would disappear but change, and understanding the business, communication skills, teamwork with people and AI would differentiate good developers with **strategist mentality** to bad ones.

## Comments

### Aaron Hui
Interesting article! A quote that I found notable from the article is "While AI can write individual components of a system, it can’t yet design how all those parts fit together, at least very well". I think this really highlights the importance of learning the foundations of how software engineering works, since from what I've taken away from this class so far, it's important to understand how all the parts of a project fit together when planning one, even if each individual developer only contributes to an individual component at a time. The article also really demonstrates how controversial AI is, especially when you scroll down to the comments and look at all the discourse there.
